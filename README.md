# Banking App

* The app is used to transfer money between multiple users and also record transactions.
* This repository contains the app which I made as a mobile app developer in The Sparks Foundation.
* The app is made with flutter and uses SQLite as a backend.

A mobile app that has the following specs:
* Start with creating dummy data in mobile (SQLite) database for up to 10 users.
*  User table will have basic fields such as name, email, current balance, etc. 
*  Transfers table will record all transfers that happened.
*  Flow Home Screen --> View all Customers --> Select and View one Customer --> Transfer Money --> Select customer to transfer to --> View all Customers.
*  No Login Page, No Customer Creation. Only transfer of money between multiple customers.
